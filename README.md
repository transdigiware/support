# ZenHub 

<a href="https://zenhub.com"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZenHubIO/support/master/zenhub-badge.png"></a>

**ZenHub is how the world's best development teams work together.** 🎈 

As the only project management tool integrated natively in GitHub’s UI, ZenHub helps you stay in your workflow without distractions. There are no new queues to check, entries to update, or priorities to manage outside GitHub. 

Because ZenHub’s features are powered by native GitHub issues, it doesn’t create more process – it gets out of your way so you can focus on shipping awesome products.

Download the ZenHub extension for Firefox or Chrome [here](http://www.zenhub.com). It’s free for public, academic, and personal repositories. It's also free for teams under six on unlimited private repositories!

**Flexible Boards** enable teams to visualize entire projects without leaving GitHub. Whether you prefer kanban, agile, or your own flavor of workflow, ZenHub supports it all. You can also connect task boards for projects that span several repos or even organizations. 

### Epics inside Github

By adding a crucial “extra layer” of hierarchy to your issues, Epics make it easy to build, execute, and maintain a healthy product backlog. 

### Slack Integration

## Submitting issues to the support repo

We use ZenHub to help make this process easy.  Visit our task board (press `b` with ZenHub installed) to see current issues, organized as:

### 1 - Inbox (to be reviewed)

The first pipeline a new issue will hit. This lets us know what needs our attention.

### 2 - Discussion

An issue will get moved here when we are looking for some community feedback, so don't forget to add GitHub reactions to those issues you would like to see! Bug reports or issues awaiting replies will also be moved to discussion to keep the inbox clear.

### 3 - Community Backlog

Features that the ZenHub team are working on, or will be in the future.

### 4 - Known Issues

Issues we know about and are working to resolve.

### 4 - Priorities

Features/feedback we are actively looking into that align with our roadmap and future milestones.

### 5 - Up Next 

The next few big issues that are in the pipeline.

### 6 - In Progress

What we are currently working on.
